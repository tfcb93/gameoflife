# CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE

Those days I decided I should do Conway's Game of Life since I never did (even in university).  
I decided to do it without looking at other implementations, only reading the rules and using [bitstorm](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) in comparison.  
I also wanted to do it in JavaScript since I was learning canvas and I work a lot with JS.  

## How to use it

* Download or clone it
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`

I also recommend to use the live server to see it or just use the content inside the dist folder.

## Final thoughts

I know there is plenty of room for this to get better, but I'm feeling confident to launch it publicly. I still want to improve this implementation, but I also want to share it already.
