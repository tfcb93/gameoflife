# CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE

Those days I decided I should do Conway's Game of Life since I never did (even in university).  
I decided to do it without looking at other implementations, only reading the rules and using [bitstorm](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) in comparison.  
I also wanted to do it in JavaScript since I was learning canvas and I work a lot with JS.
